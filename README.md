Design and develop a backend application (A simple program without any frontend(UI) which
we can run locally) with the following functionality, along the lines of survey form applications
like Typeform, Google Forms etc, it must have APIs defined in the basic section (Mentioned
Below) & then try adding APIs mentioned in the Next section.

BASIC
1. An API to create surveys.
2. An API to store the survey responses.
3. An API to fetch survey responses.
Next
1. The user filling out the form should be able to Edit Responses multiple times after
submission.
2. An API to List all the responses submitted by a user for a form.
